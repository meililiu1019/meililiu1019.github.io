## Creating Your Own Member Page

We've created a couple of templates for you to easily set up your own individual "About Me" pages. If you have any questions or are running into issues, please contact Haana.

### Member Page Set-Up

To create your own member page, follow the steps below.
  1. Go to the Team folder.
  2. Open template.md and copy all the contents inside the file.
  3. Go back to the Team folder.
  4. Create a new Markdown file in the format firstname-lastname.md
  5. Paste what you copied from the template file into your own file that you just created.
  6. Fill out all necessary fields.
And you have your own individual page set up!

### Team Page Setup

Making a change to your own member page - such as changing the picture or social media links - will not automatically make a change to the people.md (the Team page) page. If you would like to change a link or picture, follow the steps below. These are also instructions provided on people.md.
  1. Open people.md.
  2. If you are a new member adding your profile to the Team page, copy the code provided at the beginning of people.md and add it to the end of the file (but before the RA section). Fill out the necessary fields.
  3. If you are making an edit to your profile, simply scroll down to your section (each section is marked by a name) and change the fields necessay (aka profile pic, social media icon, etc.).

## Adding Pictures or Posters

To add any pictures or posters (PDFs), upload them to the Assets folder. This is the only way a picture/poster will show up on the website. If needed, you may create a subfolder within Assets.

## Adding a Lab Update

A cool feature of our site is the ability to add your own updates - like a mini blog! All posts that are published will be in the _posts folder. If you would like to create a draft, put your file in the _drafts folder. Follow the instructions below to create your post. The same instructions are available in the template.md file in the _drafts folder.
  1. Go the _drafts folder.
  2. Open template.md and copy all the contents inside the file.
  3. Go back to the _drafts folder.
  4. Create a new Markdown file in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md". 
  5. Paste what you copied from the template file into your own file that you just created.
  3. Make sure you change the following variables (found at the top of the file):
      - change the date/time (date variable) 
      - change the title of the post (title variable)
      - change the catergory (category variable)
      - do **NOT** change the **layout variable**
  4. Once you have finished writing out your post, move your Markdown file to the _posts folder where it will then be automatically published to the site. 

For questions on how to format the post using MarkDown, check out the "Welcome to Jekyll" Markdown file (available in _drafts) or check out syntax online.
