# About

Meili (Mandy) Liu is a Post-doctoral Associate in the Civil & Architectural Engineering Department at University of Miami. Her research focuses on computational methods, especially the use of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and machine learning (ML)to guide the development of novel infrastructure materials. Currently, Dr. Liu is focused on two specific reserch thrusts: 1ï¼‰Modification of biochar; 2) Asphalt aging.

Dr. Liu earned a joint Ph.D. in Chemistry, specializing in Physical Chemistry, from the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), and Beijing Normal University in December 2021. Since then, she has been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Miami.

Welcome **Collaboration** with Experimental Research Groups

As a computational chemist, I am open to establishing diverse forms of collaboration with experimental research teams. If your group has experimental challenges that could benefit from computational modeling or simulation, I would be delighted to explore how we can work together.

Whether you are seeking insights into molecular dynamics, quantum mechanical calculations, or multi-scale modeling, I am eager to support your research with computational tools to complement your experimental work.

Please feel free to reach out **mxl2120@miami.edu** if you are interested in discussing potential collaboration opportunities.
