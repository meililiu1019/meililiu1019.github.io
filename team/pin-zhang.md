# __Bio__
[Meili (Mandy) Liu](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/zhangpin/) is the Post-Doctoral Associate under the [Presidential Young Professorship](https://www.nus.edu.sg/careers/nus-programmes/) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Miami (UM). Before joining UM, Dr. Liu worked at the University of Cambridge as the Royal Society Newton International Fellow (2022-2024). He completed the Ph.D. from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in 2022, including one year at the University of Oxford as a visiting scholar.  

New knowledge is demonstrated by publications in high-impact journals such as [Géotechnique](https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/toc/jgeot/current), [JGGE](https://ascelibrary.org/journal/jggefk) and [CMAME](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computer-methods-in-applied-mechanics-and-engineering). Two journal papers were recognized as Editor’s Choice by *JEM-ASCE* and *FSCE*, and five papers were recognized as the journal’s top cited/downloaded.  

Dr ZHANG was also the recipient of Early Career Award from Institution of Civil Engineers, Turing Network Development Award, Ringo Yu Prize from The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, PolyU PhD thesis-Merit Award, Hunan Provincial Outstanding Master's Dissertation and Hunan University Outstanding Graduate.
