# __Bio__
[Meili (Mandy) Liu](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/zhangpin/) is a Post-doctoral Associate in the Civil & Architectural Engineering Department at University of Miami. Her research focuses on computational methods, especially the use of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and machine learning (ML)to guide the development of novel infrastructure materials. Currently, Dr. Liu is focused on two specific reserch thrusts: 1）Modification of biochar; 2) Asphalt aging.

Dr. Liu earned a joint Ph.D. in Chemistry, specializing in Physical Chemistry, from the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), and Beijing Normal University in December 2021. Since then, she has been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Miami.
